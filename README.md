# Statistical Inference
Data analysis and statistical inference with R

## Problem description
A friend has been learning driving for some time, and is thinking of taking the practical car test. They can either take the test at the nearest test centre to their home, or at the nearest test centre to the school. It is widely believed that the driving test routes around some centres are probably more difficult than others (e.g. there are far less bus lanes, roundabouts and cyclists in rural areas than in London).

# Task
The aim of this analysis is the find the expecting passing rate at the two test centres, as well as to make a recommendation as to there should they take the test, based on statistical evidence. This report should be understood by a non-expert in statistics.

## Remarks
This project is submitted as part of assessed coursework.
